# Overview

Upon logging in, Treehouse allows users to click through their family tree! On each family member's profile card, you're able to see their parents, spouse, and all of their children. We've provided a seamless process for users to be able to navigate through even the most complicated family trees, with everyone's contact information right at your fingertips.
